In this article I reflect on my university experience. This is a reflection on the educational component, my interests over the course of university, and how the experience has shaped my career goals.  
- I discuss my mindset at different points   
- I highlight more *memorable courses*: my experience, the things I learned, and any projects I worked on.

## Coming into University

Before I ended up at engineering, I was seriously considering medicine. One of the reasons I really wanted to be a doctor was I had this narrow perspective that it was the best way to have 'impact'. In hindsight it was just much more tangible to me at the time. In my opinion, engineering and what it entails is much more abstract to grasp than medicine - from a highschooler's perspective.

I remember a conversation I had with a family member a little before I started preparing for university applications; they emphasized that an engineer might have "impact" if  they built the infrastructure required to bring water to a village that historically struggled with water security. Seems kind of silly and obvious in hindsight, but this example helped correct my limited and naive perspective.

On that note, thank you to all those workers who dedicate themselves to having a positive influence on their community, from firefighter to barista.
## Early Years

I entered UofT engineering under the Track One (undeclared) stream, later declaring my ECE major at the end of first year. After the excitement of first year wore off, I felt a dissatisfaction with what I was learning. It felt disconnected from real world problems. The content was highly theoretical - and it was very very rigorous. I enjoyed this rigor for the courses that I was interested in, but it felt like in a year's worth of studying there would be ~3-4 courses out of 10 I enjoyed. This wasn't a sustainable ratio - and naturally these difficult courses left me exhausted. 

**Maintaining a Passion for Learning**

Although I started to fall out of love with the program, I remained passionate about learning and funneled my energy into the topics I was curious of. The 2nd year of the ECE program was very heavy - but if nothing else it identified to me my comfort in programming, and software engineering more generally. Enjoying and being successful in my programming courses like <a href="#ece244">ECE244 & ECE297</a> gave me a sense of confidence and certainty in the direction I was specializing.

By the end of my second year, I realized how essential collaboration is in programming, both in open source and industry. This also gave me a deeper understanding of how programming and software engineering are organized, with developers building on top of each others' code to create new solutions.

## A Gap in the Engineering Curriculum
My issue is I felt my interests and the direction of the engineering curriculum were slightly out of sync. It felt like the curriculum prioritized equipping me with the skills to (in order):
<ol>
	<li>Continue pursuing technical topics in higher education (Masters/PhD with a STEM focus, CS, Engineering, etc.)</li>
	<li>Be productive in industry</li>
</ol>

Meanwhile, my priorities looked like
<ol>
	<li>Be productive in industry</li>
	<li>Learning about my social responsibilities as an engineer:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Which problems are worthy of my current and future skills as an engineer?</li>
			<li>How can I optimize my career for social impact?</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Pursuing education further (Masters/Phd)</li>
</ol>

Other students or professors may argue global development / engineering is woven into our program - citing courses like PPG402: Public policy analysis for engineers or <a href=#aps420>APS420: Tech, Eng, & Global Development</a>. Although I agree, these are non-technical electives which were super limited in my engineering degree. Also, I would have loved to take PPG302/402 but I didn't even know they exist! We don't need thousands of engineering graduates dreaming to work for Microsoft, Nvidia, Raytheon, Chevron, Palantir or whatever is "hot" these days. We need engineers graduating with more complete world views and more intention in their career.

I don't mean to speak on behalf of engineers nor would I ever accuse us of being apathetic to our social responsibilities - or worse. I only mean to have a more in depth conversation on how political will and economic factors influence where engineering talent is deployed in our society.
  
In engineering education, we don't adequately explore the political and economic factors that shape how resources are allocated. As future engineers, we should be asking critical questions like:
- What kind of engineering projects is capital currently flowing into, and what are the driving interests of both private and public stakeholders?
- How are decisions made about which industries receive funding, how do these choices reflect the current political climate, and what are the broader societal and environmental impacts?
- Most importantly, what is the role of engineers in influencing these decisions, and how can we ensure that the projects we work on contribute to long-term societal well-being?
These discussions are often overlooked in technical curricula, but they are crucial for understanding the broader context in which engineering operates.

With all that said, it would be shallow analysis to blame everything on the administration. This mentality exists at all levels of education as an institution. Including the student level. I'm sure lots of my friends from university would disagree or at least would not place as much emphasis on this component of our education I feel we missed out on.

To summarize, I'm not convinced that a technical engineering course I was taking for a breadth requirement, (that I had no interest in pursuing in the future) is the best use of my time to becoming a more complete and successful engineer. All engineering programs have some form of Engineering Economics & Analysis course (e.g ECE472); Make a similar program requirement: a policy and development   course for engineers.

## Graduating Mindset

**Upper Year Interests**

In my 3rd and 4th years I developed a clearer vision of what I wanted to study further. I also had more space in my schedule to take the electives I wanted. <a href='#aps360'>APS360 - Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning</a> was probably my favorite course in 3rd year and continued to foster my growing interest in ML. I loved the professor's balance between theory and labs. It gave me a practical (using PyTorch) understanding of the *basic* components used to build ML architectures.

Early 3rd year is also around the time when I was getting interested in robotics. I didn't get a chance to study it further in university (except briefly at UTRA in my last semester), but I made an active effort during my co-op's job search to find a role that would let me explore this interest. This is ultimately how I ended up at JCA. Their job description specifically mentioned ROS2 which I wanted to gain experience in.

Finally, I have to highlight <a href='#aps420'>APS420 - Technology, Engineering, & Global Development</a>. This course gave me opportunity to explore the history of international frameworks for development; and approaches to developing appropriate and inclusive technology. I want to thank my professor, Nicole Weckman, for being a great teacher and creating a space conductive to interesting conversations. 
 
**What's next for Ali?**

Generally I want to continue my career as a software engineer, diligently cultivating those engineering skills that are independent of  specialization. I also want to focus on growing my technical skills in ML and data science more broadly. Career wise, I hope I'll get an opportunity to use these skills in a setting that lets me work on interesting and real problems, something like a public sector position.
 
## Noteworthy Courses

**ESP - Engineering Strategies and Practice**

Engineering Strategies and Practice (ESP) is a year long design course that uses the
engineering design process as context for developing skills essential to the practice of
engineering like:
- Systems thinking
- Problem solving
- Professional Communication

I really enjoyed learning about the different stages of the engineering design process; it's a skill that has proved useful in the planning and execution of projects in my work experiences, both professional and otherwise.
I do feel I adopted a systems approach to thinking over the course of my degree. I use this approach in both technical endeavors and also when interpreting the world around me.

**ECE244 - Programming Fundamentals**

This course rigorously covered the fundamental concepts of object oriented programming. It also went into depth on how memory is managed. This was particularly insightful since I was taking a computer architecture course at the same time. Overall gave me the confidence in my ability to learn new programming languages and libraries/technologies.

**ECE297 - Software Communication and Design**

This was a purely project based course with a relatively ambitious scope; meant to test the OOP concepts studied in ECE244 within the context of C++ (using the STL).

The main goal was to develop a functional Geographic Information System (GIS) by using OpenStreetsMap as the API for the data, GTK for graphics, and implement various kinds of functionality like search and pathfinding.

This is probably the only course project I worked on where time complexity actually mattered since N (# of street intersections) was so large for some maps (like Tokyo ) that code had to be efficient to deliver a usable app.

The final deliverable of the project was implementing a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">travelling salesman problem</a>. This was actually a great opportunity for me to apply "Leetcode hard" level concepts like memoization to solve a problem efficiently.

**MAT291 - Calculus 3**

I actually really enjoyed the theory of multivariable calculus but unfortunately I took this during 2nd year of ECE which was particularly heavy. As a result I couldn't properly devote myself and engage with the course. Fortunately, I had a chance to work with multivariable calculus concepts again in ML courses I took later.

**APS360 - Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning**

This course gave me a foundational understanding of basic deep learning architectures. I learned about the underlying calculus that goes into training a basic/textbook neural network (loss function / gradient descent). I also
learned about other components used in ML architectures like: CNNs, GANs, RNNs, and Transformers.

In this course I built a CNN to classify American Sign Language (ASL). This was actually quite fun because the data wasn't sourced online but from the students themselves which also taught me a few things on producing synthetic data.

<b id='aps420'>APS420 - Technology, Engineering, & Global Development</b>

This is the only course which I feel created a real space to talk about "real world" problems. It certainly helped that the class size was small. The actual learning outcomes were on how global development was historically conducted, and what things modern frameworks of international development try to do to be better. It also focused on the concepts of appropriate and inclusive technologies; concepts I will certainly keep in mind when interpreting problems and designing solutions in the future.
