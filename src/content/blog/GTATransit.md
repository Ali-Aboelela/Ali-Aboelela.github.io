This article discusses public transit systems in the city of Toronto using the GO train network as a case study. It is a cautionary tale on the consequences and causes of car dependent public transit. It summarizes:
- Failures of car-centric transit systems in the GTA including my personal experience with them;
- and the different forces that act on decision makers resulting in car-centric public transit
  
**Motivation** 
I watched *[this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxWjtpzCIfA&t=379s )* video by NJB when it first came out. After living in Toronto for 4+ years I've watched it again recently and have gained a deeper appreciation of the criticisms NJB made. *[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGG4c7-bAAE)* by RMTransit helped me understand why things are the way they are. Many (but not all) of the talking points I make are inspired by these videos.

## **Consequences of Car Dependency on Transit Infrastructure**

How key nodes in the GTA's public transit system are developed gives us insight on who the space is meant to be servicing. It also reflects and influences how culture develops in Toronto. 

### **Misuse of Real Estate**

Have you seen the average GO Train station in a GTA suburb?

**Parking as a Subsidy**

They're just massive parking lots. Transit stations should be the center of human activity, not car storage. The space is absolutely inhospitable to pedestrians or anything that isn't in a vehicle.

This setup not only wastes valuable l and but also reinforces car dependency, defeating the purpose of developing a public transit system in the first place. Going from place to place via public transit should be convenient, you shouldn't have to put much thought into how you'll "plug in" to the network. In other words: you shouldn't have to travel significant distances to reach the closest station. The transit station should be embedded within a walkable neighborhood or commercial area - not a pitstop that requires you to be in a car. 

Demand is induced. If at any point we are *forcing* people to use cars to access the public transit system, then the system is already a failure. Obviously stations need to accommodate cars, but the stations need to be designed around the human first.

There are also economic reasons cities shouldn't want massive parking lots around key transit nodes - not least of which is how valuable land around transit stations is. Free parking provided by tax payers is a subsidy, and a [drain on city's finances](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IsMeKl-Sv0). It gets even worse when you consider the opportunity cost: financially productive mixed use development.

**The Insanity of Commuter Rail**

The tragedy of the GO Train network is it's actually super high quality, clean, and comfortable - but services such a targeted demographic that it has no real use for most other people. Consider these figures: (data sourced from NJB's video linked at the top of this article):

***Mode of Travel: SUBURB -> DOWNTOWN***

***Mode of Travel: SUBURB -> NOT DOWNTOWN***

In other words, if you're not trying to commute from a suburb to downtown or vice versa, then you're probably not going to use the GO Train. Meanwhile, the actual trains themselves waste so much time sitting in downtown waiting to take suburbanites home when they're done with their workday. After the morning rush, lets say between 9:30 am and 3 pm, the GO trains sit idly at the Don Yard. Tragic.

### **Cultural Effects**

**Poor Suburb - Suburb Connectivity**

We have acknowledged that the poor connectivity of the GO Train is a result of intentional design to bring suburban commuters to downtown for work and then back home at the end of the day. This poor connectivity, specifically the lack of, suburb-to-suburb connectivity reinforces pockets of cultural isolation. A quick glance at the GO Train system map quickly puts things into perspective.

By focusing only on transporting workers to Toronto, the GO system reinforces the segregation of suburban communities along cultural lines, leaving little room for cross-suburban social interaction. This perpetuates cultural isolation, as many Canadians are confined to their respective communities, with limited exposure to others. Of course cars exist and the GO Train layout isn't solely responsible, but the cultural divide between the GTA's suburbs is real.

In university I remember a professor using the term "Cultural Mosaic" to describe Canada, as opposed to the US's "Cultural Melting Pot".  By focusing on car-dependent, ***commuter-based*** transit, the GO system unintentionally contributes to the conditions that create this cultural divide.
### **Metrolinx is Improving**

The things I'm saying aren't controversial or new. Metrolinx already recognizes all of this and is working on some exciting projects.

Within the City of Toronto, Metrolinx continues its great work with the Ontario Line. In the suburbs, Metrolinx is helping set up light rail transit (LRT) systems like the **Hurontario LRT** in Mississauga, the **Hamilton LRT**, and the **Eglinton Crosstown West Extension**. These projects are essential steps toward improving transit accessibility outside of Toronto's core, offering alternatives to car travel and linking suburban communities with major transit hubs. The GO Expansion, which aims to provide all-day, two-way service, will also enhance connectivity in suburbs like Barrie, Stouffville, and Kitchener.

Metrolinx also has a **Transit-Oriented Community (TOC)** initiative, designed to address the problems of car dependency by building mixed-use, high-density developments around transit stations.

It remains to be seen if this will be executed correctly, given the various forces acting on Metrolinx. For example, [this CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/provincial-land-transit-hub-private-developer-sale-1.6330555) discusses the sale of parking space near **Port Credit** to land developers. It highlights how the need for _affordable_ housing is often at odds with the city's desire to maximize returns on the sale of prime real estate (which would require fewer restrictions on how the land is developed) for future transit investment.

It will certainly take decades of focused, intentional work to reverse the effects of decades of car-centric city planning, but Metrolinx is taking the right steps by prioritizing transit-friendly development across the region. Their recognition of these issues through initiatives like the TOC gives some hope for the future of public transit in the GTA.
