            Generally my professional experience has been as a SWE in robotics (working with ROS2).
            <li>I’m impressed by recent advances in machine learning thanks to the transformer and scale:</li>

                <li>Less interested in researching cutting edge architectures, although I have a great respect for those people that push the boundaries.</li>
                <li>
                    More interested in deploying and scaling the tech that exists today. Lots of use cases excite me: urban design, government policy, analytics
                    in general (for industrial/commercial use cases).

                <li>
                    Interested in the intersection of IoT / data science. I believe the bottleneck for impactful products and services isn't compute or model
                    architecture but rather a lack of sustainable sources of quality domain or problem specific data.
