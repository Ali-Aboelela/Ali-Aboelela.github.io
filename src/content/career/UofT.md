In this article I reflect on my university experience. This is a reflection on the educational component, my interests over the course of university, and how the experience has shaped my career goals.  
- I discuss my mindset at different points   
- I highlight more *memorable courses*: my experience, the things I learned, and any projects I worked on.

## Early Years

I entered UofT engineering under the Track One (undeclared) stream, later declaring my ECE major at the end of first year. After the excitement of first year wore off, I felt a dissatisfaction with what I was learning. It felt disconnected from real world problems. The content was highly theoretical - and it was very very rigorous. I enjoyed this rigor for the courses that I was interested in, but it felt like in a year's worth of studying there would be ~3-4 courses out of 10 I enjoyed. This wasn't a sustainable ratio - and naturally these difficult courses left me exhausted. 

**Maintaining a Passion for Learning**

Although I started to fall out of love with the program, I remained passionate about learning and funneled my energy into the topics I was curious of. The 2nd year of the ECE program was very heavy - but if nothing else it identified to me my comfort in programming, and software engineering more generally. Enjoying and being successful in my programming courses like <a href="#ece244">ECE244 & ECE297</a> gave me a sense of confidence and certainty in the direction I was specializing.

By the end of my second year, I realized how essential collaboration is in programming, both in open source and industry. This also gave me a deeper understanding of how programming and software engineering are organized, with developers building on top of each others' code to create new solutions.

## A Gap in the Engineering Curriculum
My issue is I felt my interests and the direction of the engineering curriculum were slightly out of sync. It felt like the curriculum prioritized equipping me with the skills to (in order):
<ol>
	<li>Continue pursuing technical topics in higher education (Masters/PhD with a STEM focus, CS, Engineering, etc.)</li>
	<li>Be productive in industry</li>
</ol>

Meanwhile, my priorities looked like
<ol>
	<li>Be productive in industry</li>
	<li>Learning about my social responsibilities as an engineer:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Which problems are worthy of my current and future skills as an engineer?</li>
			<li>How can I optimize my career for social impact?</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Pursuing education further (Masters/Phd)</li>
</ol>

Other students or professors may argue global development / engineering is woven into our program - citing courses like PPG402: Public policy analysis for engineers or <a href=#aps420>APS420: Tech, Eng, & Global Development</a>. Although I agree, these are non-technical electives which were super limited in an engineering degree. We don't the majority of engineering graduates dreaming to work for Microsoft, Nvidia, Raytheon, Chevron, Palantir or whatever is "hot" these days. We need engineers to be graduating with more complete world views and more intention in their career.

I don't mean to speak on behalf of engineers nor would I ever accuse us of being apathetic to our social responsibilities - or worse. I only mean to have a more in depth conversation on how political will and economic factors influence where engineering talent is deployed in our society.
  
In engineering education, we don't adequately explore the political and economic factors that shape how resources are allocated. As future engineers, we should be asking critical questions like:
- What kind of engineering projects is capital currently flowing into, and what are the driving interests of both private and public stakeholders?
- How are decisions made about which industries receive funding, how do these choices reflect the current political climate, and what are the broader societal and environmental impacts?
- Most importantly, what is the role of engineers in influencing these decisions, and how can we ensure that the projects we work on contribute to long-term societal well-being?
These discussions are often overlooked in technical curricula, but they are crucial for understanding the broader context in which engineering operates.

With all that said, it would be shallow analysis to blame everything on the administration. This mentality exists at all levels of education as an institution. Including the student level. I'm sure lots of my friends from university would disagree or at least would not place as much emphasis on this component of our education I feel we missed out on.

To summarize, I'm not convinced that a technical engineering course I was taking for a breadth requirement, (that I had no interest in pursuing in the future) is the best use of my time to becoming a more complete and successful engineer. All engineering programs have some form of Engineering Economics & Analysis course (e.g ECE472); Make a similar program requirement: a policy and development   course for engineers.

## Graduating Mindset

**Upper Year Interests**

In my 3rd and 4th years I developed a clearer vision of what I wanted to study further. There were 2 things I was interested in.

First, I wanted to continue learning about ML, but much more generally about using statistical methods and computation to solve real world problems. <a href='#aps360'>APS360 - Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning</a> was probably my favorite course in 3rd year and continued to foster my growing interest in ML. I loved the professor's balance between theory and labs. It gave me a practical (using PyTorch) understanding of the *basic* components used to build ML architectures.

Second, I wanted to learn more about the field of robotics. I didn't get a chance to study it further in university (except briefly at UTRA in my last semester), but I made an active effort during my co-op's job search to find a role that would let me explore this interest. This is ultimately how I ended up at JCA. Their job description specifically mentioned ROS2 which I wanted to gain experience in.

Outside of my technical interests I was still searching for guidance on how I can apply my engineering skills to worthy real world problems. APS420 piqued my interest. The learning outcomes were on how global development was historically conducted, and what things modern frameworks of international development try to do to be better. It also focused on the concepts of appropriate and inclusive technologies; concepts I will certainly keep in mind when interpreting problems and designing solutions in the future.

 
**What's next for Ali?**

Generally I want to continue my career as a software engineer, diligently cultivating those engineering skills that are independent of  specialization. I also want to focus on growing my technical skills in (broadly speaking) computational statistics, computer networking, and DevOps/Automation. Career wise, I hope I'll get an opportunity to use these skills in a setting that lets me work on interesting and real problems, something like a public sector position.
